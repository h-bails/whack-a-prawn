# __Whack-a-Prawn - Portfolio Project 2__
This is a website for Whack-a-Prawn, a whack-a-mole style game with a twist. The user’s yard has been taken over by [Parktown Prawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parktown_prawn), a large species of (much-disliked) cricket native to South Africa. The user will have to eliminate a certain amount of prawns from the yard in order to win the game. If the user misses 5 prawns, they lose the game.

The aim of this project was to build an interactive front-end site using Javascript, which responds to the user's actions and changes the way the site displays information according to said actions.

## __UX & Design__
This is a simple game requiring only one page, with modal pop-ups for instructions and notifications. The remaining design is fairly simple, allowing the user to focus on the game without distraction.

### __Wireframes__
Before the project build commenced, I used Figma to draw a loose wireframe of the final result.

### __Typography__
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to select and import the fonts used in the body text (Mulish).

I designed the logo myself using [Canva](https://canva.com).

## __Features__ 

- __Favicon__
    - A small insect serves as the favicon, so the user can easily identify the game’s tab in the browser.

- __Whack-a-Prawn Logo__
    - The logo appears at the top of the page and shows the user the name of the game.

- __Control Buttons__
    - The top buttons (or rather, links) allow the user to control music, view instructions, and start the game.

- __Toggle Music button__
    -  This button allows the user to toggle the game's music. The music is turned ‘off’ by default as per best practice.

- __Toggle Instructions button__
     - This button allows the user to view the premise of the game and how to play.

- __Instructions Modal__
    - The instructions pop-up appears when the user clicks on the instructions button and explains the game's rules and controls. The box can be closed by clicking the "OK!" button at the bottom of the modal.

- __Game Area__
    - The game area consists of 9 ‘holes’ from which a prawn will pop up at random. There is also a scoreboard to the left to track how many prawns have been hit and/or missed.

- __Footer__
    - The footer displays my name, the Code Institute module, and a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages.
